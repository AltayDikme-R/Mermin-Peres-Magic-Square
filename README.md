## Overview 

This repository contains the python scripts used to perform the six measurements in the Mermin-Peres Magic Square on IBM's quantum computers using the `qiskit` library. 

## Usage

In order to use the code in this repository the `qiskit` library must be installed. The best way to do this is using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install qiskit
```

See the [Official README](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/master/README.md) for general instructions or 
the [Installing Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/master/docs/install.rst) page for a more detailed installation guide. 

Furthermore an IBM Quantum Experience account is required in order to configure an API key in order to send jobs to IBM Q systems. This is also explained in the [Installing Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/master/docs/install.rst) page.

Once these prerequisites have been completed this repository may be cloned and the scripts may be used in order to perform the measurements in the Mermin-Peres Magic Square.

## Documentation
