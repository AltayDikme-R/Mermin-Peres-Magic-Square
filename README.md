## Overview 

This repository contains the python scripts used to perform the six measurements in the Mermin-Peres Magic Square on IBM's quantum computers using the `qiskit` library. 

## Usage

In order to use the code in this repository the `qiskit` library must be installed. The best way to do this is using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install qiskit
```
